MVP
    Generate Arrow while selecting
    Better enemy ai
        We use A* when we go after a unit, but we don't use it when choosing the
            closest unit yet.
        Ranged Attacks
        BUG | AI actions don't move the viewport.
        BUG | After attacking, TileInfo doesn't update.
    IMGUI
        Level Saving/Editing/Loading

BUGS
    Constant Framerate seems to not work.
        Debug without IMGUI, I think that library makes framerate constant on
        its own.

NICE
    More Asserts everywhere
    Level Transitions/Win Screen
    Rendering
        Animation
            Placing Unit moves them smoothly to that square (A-star)
        Draw Attack range squares
        Background Tiles
        Character sprites when hovering
    BUG | Just cycle through possible targets when targeting, don't allow them to
    move around willy-nilly!
    BUG | Can only attack or heal if there are targets
    Enemy healing?
    Enemy AI Goes for "beneficial trades"
        Higher damage output than input.
        kills

REFACTOR
    The Grid code is a mess, but it could probably just be like 3 functions.
    The animation system needs an overhaul.
    remove unique_ptrs. Just allocate and free the memory ourselves.
    big unit storage refactor
        No more allies and enemies vectors, just one big vector we iterate through.
        Change the structure of our units/level structs.
            Make the units be an array, where each unit's pointer is kept at
            its given id space.
            Then, make the level's "allies" and "enemies"
            vectors each just contain ids, which index into that array.
        Will be faster, simpler, and easier to reason about.
        Will also lead to just one source of units, which is a great place to be.
