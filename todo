MVP
    UI Tweaks
        Pressing up or down on a unit's Stats page brings you to the next unit's
        stats page (And also moves your cursor to them)
        Check Gamepad functionality

    Tweak Units
    More accurate HIT calculations, with tile avoid factored in.
    10 levels
    Better enemy ai
        We use A* when we go after a unit, but we don't use it when choosing the
            closest unit yet.
            Manhattan Distance doesn't have to be used by the UI as well.
        Ranged units set up for and calculate for ranged attacks
    Level Transitions/Win Screen

NICE
    Start turn on Zarathustra
        BUG | Fix the issue at the start of the player's turn where we put the
        cursor over 0, 0, and there's a unit there, but it doesn't update the
        interface state properly.
    Battle Animations
    Conversations
    Audio
        Sound Effects
        Drum-n-bass Audio
            Trance-like state of playing
    Polish
        Generate true arrow for movement (with bitfields)
        Placing Unit moves them smoothly to that square (A-star)
        Draw Attack range squares
    Enemy AI Goes for "beneficial trades"
        Higher damage output than input.
        goes for kills

REFACTOR
    Complete Migration to the New UI System
    Shrink Tilesets to absolute necessity, also enforce consistency across all
        tilesets.

DESIGN
    Fort with attack bonus instead of defense?
