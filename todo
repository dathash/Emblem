        We use A* when we go after a unit, but we don't use it when choosing the
            closest unit yet.
            Manhattan Distance doesn't have to be used by the UI as well.
        Ranged units set up for and calculate for ranged attacks
    UI Tweaks
        Pressing R always brings up a unit's Stats page
        Pressing up or down on a unit's Stats page brings you to the next unit's
        stats page (And also moves your cursor to them)
        Cycle through possible targets when targeting instead of moving cursor.
        Only able to attack or heal if there are targets.

NICE
    Shrink Tilesets to absolute necessity, also enforce consistency across all
    tilesets.

            Trance-like state of playing

    Polish
        Generate true arrow for movement (with bitfields)
        Placing Unit moves them smoothly to that square (A-star)
        Draw Attack range squares
    AI
        Enemy healing?
        Enemy AI Goes for "beneficial trades"
            Higher damage output than input.
            goes for kills
    Add some normal glyphs to the bjg font (<> (), {}, &)
    BUG | Fix the issue at the start of the player's turn where we put the
    cursor over 0, 0, and there's a unit there, but it doesn't update the
    interface state properly.
