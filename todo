MVP
    Tweak Units
    Start turn on Zarathustra
    More accurate HIT calculations, with tile avoid factored in.

    10 levels
    Better enemy ai
        We use A* when we go after a unit, but we don't use it when choosing the
            closest unit yet.
            Manhattan Distance doesn't have to be used by the UI as well.
        Ranged units set up for and calculate for ranged attacks
    UI Tweaks
        Pressing R always brings up a unit's Stats page
        Pressing up or down on a unit's Stats page brings you to the next unit's
        stats page (And also moves your cursor to them)
        Cycle through possible targets when targeting instead of moving cursor.
        Only able to attack or heal if there are targets.
    Level Transitions/Win Screen

NICE
    Heal self
    Fort with attack bonus instead of defense?
    Shrink Tilesets to absolute necessity, also enforce consistency across all
    tilesets.
    Battle Animations
    Conversations
    Audio
        Sound Effects
        Drum-n-bass Audio
            Trance-like state of playing
    BUG | Flood-Fill results in duplicates sometimes (for enemies mostly)
    Polish
        Generate true arrow for movement (with bitfields)
        Placing Unit moves them smoothly to that square (A-star)
        Draw Attack range squares
    AI
        Enemy healing?
        Enemy AI Goes for "beneficial trades"
            Higher damage output than input.
            goes for kills
    Add some normal glyphs to the bjg font (<> (), {}, &)
    BUG | Fix the issue at the start of the player's turn where we put the
    cursor over 0, 0, and there's a unit there, but it doesn't update the
    interface state properly.
