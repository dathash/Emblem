MVP
    New UI System
    Cycle through possible targets when targeting instead of moving cursor.
    Only able to attack or heal if there are targets.
    Better enemy ai
        We use A* when we go after a unit, but we don't use it when choosing the
            closest unit yet.
            Manhattan Distance doesn't have to be used by the UI as well.
        Ranged units set up for and calculate for ranged attacks
    Conversations
    Battle Animations
    Level Transitions/Win Screen
    BUG | AI actions don't move the viewport.
    BUG | After attacking, TileInfo doesn't update.
    Settle on a viewport size.
    10 levels
    Heal self.

NICE
    Polish
        Generate true arrow for movement (with bitfields)
        Placing Unit moves them smoothly to that square (A-star)
        Draw Attack range squares
    AI
        Enemy healing?
        Enemy AI Goes for "beneficial trades"
            Higher damage output than input.
            goes for kills
    Audio
        Sound Effects
        Drum-n-bass Audio
            Trance-like state of playing
    Easy: Make tiles global.
    More Asserts everywhere
    BUG | Constant Framerate seems to not work.
        Debug without IMGUI, I think that library makes framerate constant on
        its own.
    Test out an items system.

REFACTOR
    The Grid code is a mess, but it could probably just be like 3 functions.
    big unit storage refactor
        remove unique ptrs. Just allocate and free the memory ourselves.
        Open Questions:
            * Should the Map contain all tiles, which contain all units?
            * Should The Level contain maps and units, and units contain
              references to their tiles?
        I don't really know.
