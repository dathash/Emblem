MVP
    Better enemy ai
        We use A* when we go after a unit, but we don't use it when choosing the
            closest unit yet.
        Ranged Attacks

NICE
    Level Transitions/Win Screen
    Generate Arrow while selecting
    Placing Unit moves them smoothly to that square (A-star)
    Draw Attack range squares
    Background Tiles
    BUG | Just cycle through possible targets when targeting, don't allow them to
        move around willy-nilly!
    BUG | Can only attack or heal if there are targets
    Enemy healing?
    Enemy AI Goes for "beneficial trades"
        Higher damage output than input.
        kills
    BUG | Constant Framerate seems to not work.
        Debug without IMGUI, I think that library makes framerate constant on
        its own.
    BUG | Paths are still generated when we target walls, unless we don't border
    any open space. There's a lot weird going on here, and it can be pretty
    simple if done right.
    More Asserts everywhere
    Easy: Make tiles global.
    BUG | AI actions don't move the viewport.
    BUG | After attacking, TileInfo doesn't update.

REFACTOR
    The Grid code is a mess, but it could probably just be like 3 functions.
    The animation system needs an overhaul.
    remove unique ptrs. Just allocate and free the memory ourselves.
    big unit storage refactor
        Open Questions:
            * Should the Map contain all tiles, which contain all units?
            * Should The Level contain maps and units, and units contain
              references to their tiles?
        I don't really know.
