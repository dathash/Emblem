MVP
    Better enemy ai
        We use A* when we go after a unit, but we don't use it when choosing the
            closest unit yet.
        Ranged Attacks
    Conversations
    Battle Animations
    Level Transitions/Win Screen
    Cycle through possible targets when targeting instead of moving cursor.
    Only able to attack or heal if there are targets.
    BUG | AI actions don't move the viewport.
    BUG | After attacking, TileInfo doesn't update.

NICE
    Polish
        Generate true arrow for movement (with bitfields)
        Placing Unit moves them smoothly to that square (A-star)
        Draw Attack range squares
    AI
        Enemy healing?
        Enemy AI Goes for "beneficial trades"
            Higher damage output than input.
            goes for kills
    Easy: Make tiles global.
    More Asserts everywhere
    BUG | Constant Framerate seems to not work.
        Debug without IMGUI, I think that library makes framerate constant on
        its own.


REFACTOR
    The Grid code is a mess, but it could probably just be like 3 functions.
    big unit storage refactor
        remove unique ptrs. Just allocate and free the memory ourselves.
        Open Questions:
            * Should the Map contain all tiles, which contain all units?
            * Should The Level contain maps and units, and units contain
              references to their tiles?
        I don't really know.
