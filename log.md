Plan
> Build a fun little game!

# Design
Group mechanics (Units nearby eachother get bonuses)
Leader mechanics (Genealogy stars)
Fort with attack bonus instead of defense
Misty Step
Area of Effect
Grapple Mechanic, to hold units back so that Zarathustra can charge to the end.

Ability system, like that of D&D.

Simple statistics
I like the Two-handed fighter ability to reroll 1's.
I like the FTD mechanic where halberds can use intelligence for damage.

I like the idea of magic items which gain points as you use them for specific
things, like the sword that gets bonuses per-kill, or the armor that gets
stronger as it takes more hits.

I really like the dark souls Ring system, and the 5e attunement system.
Genealogy's items are pretty close too.

Movements due to attacks
* Your unit is blown back by their attack, providing a hasty retreat.
