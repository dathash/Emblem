Plan
> Build a fun little game!

# Design
What is appealing to me about tactics games?
    Permadeath sacrifices
    Taking Risks
    Gaining new team members
    The beginning of Fire Emblem games are always the best.
    Middle of a level is best.
        Beginning: Setting up, being overly cautious. Not good.
        End: Ganging up on a boss. Pretty much a waste of time.
    Individual Characters
        Strong Characterization
        Developing Relationships
 
Ideas
* Social Psychology game
    Characterization is deeply ingrained into combat.
        Characters bark, speak their minds.
            Cowardly character doesn't like getting sent to the front lines.
                Performs worse.
                Over time becomes more comfortable, confident.
            Confident character tends to overextend.
                Enemies hit them more often.
        Conversations mid-battle.

* Deep exploration of mechanics
    Fire Emblem reaches a point where it's all sort of the same.
    What if we dug in to this?
        Made mechanics that lended themselves towards extremely specific playstyles?
        Made objectives that required modes of thinking?
        Dropped RPG elements to make way for the new puzzle-style mechanic?

Why are we fighting?
Fire Emblem maps are almost always about killing all the enemies
What about other objectives?
What about Save all the Innocents?
What about Collect all the Items?
What about Escape?
What about anything else?

What do RPG Mechanics really achieve?
* Feeling of commitment to the game.
* Numbers go up hehe
* The strategic decision of nurturing a weak unit until they grow.

Group mechanics (Units nearby eachother get bonuses)
Leader mechanics (Genealogy stars)
Fort with attack bonus instead of defense
Knight Moves?
Jumping tiles in general?
Boost teammate units over stuff?
Misty Step
Area of Effect
Grapple Mechanic, to hold units back so that Zarathustra can charge to the end.

Ability system, like that of D&D.

Really explicit die-rolls.
Simple statistics
I like the Two-handed fighter ability to reroll 1's.
I like the FTD mechanic where halberds can use intelligence for damage.

I like the idea of magic items which gain points as you use them for specific
things, like the sword that gets bonuses per-kill, or the armor that gets
stronger as it takes more hits.
I really like the dark souls Ring system, and the 5e attunement system.
Genealogy's items are pretty close too.
