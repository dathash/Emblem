 Plan
======
Build a fun little game!

 Notes
=======
July 15
	I'm finding that there are many easy tasks, which are not essential, which I love to do, and few very difficult tasks,
	which are essential, which I do not want to do. It is as though the force of gravity pulls me down, away from the work
	that truly needs doing.

	Also of note is that refactoring is pretty enjoyable, especially when I write decent code. Maybe it falls into that
	category of easy tasks above, but it feels beneficial in some way.
	
	Testing, however, seems to have very little import. I will try some more, but it has some crucial flaws.
	To test the important parts of the system is difficult, and to test the trivial parts of the system is easy.
	Must reconcile these differences.
