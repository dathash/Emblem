# Emblem
Alex Hartford

A small turn-based strategy game in the vein of Fire Emblem.

A learning project in Modern C++, including:
- Smart Pointers
- Command Pattern
- OO (lite) design
- As many pure functions as I can reasonably fit

Credit to Bob Nystrom for the book Game Programming Patterns,
and to the folks on <em>The Spriter's Resource</em> for the sprites.
