SP1 Lucina
SP2 Lon'qu

ONE You fight like a demon.
TWO Strange compliment.
ONE Strange man.
TWO ...
ONE Why did you help me?
TWO The bandits raze our fields. We merely acted in our own defense.
TWO You just happened to be here.
ONE Some of these bandits look like farmers themselves. You know anything of this?
TWO It's a hard life. I don't expect you to understand.
ONE I see.
ONE ...
ONE Your name... Your brother told me it was... Lon'qu.
ONE Are you from Tolmec?
TWO No, I was born here, in the fields of Imrryr.
ONE I see.
TWO ...Why?
ONE It's just that there's a Tolmechian legend of a hero named Lon'qu.
ONE My father told me of it once. It was famous myth of that land.
TWO ...I've never heard it.
ONE A pity. You remind me of him.
TWO ...
ONE Are you coming with us to the village?
TWO I go where Donnel goes.
ONE Good.
