TWO The bandits raze our fields. We merely acted in our own defense.

EX2 Neutral
TWO You just happened to be here.

ONE Some of these bandits look like farmers themselves. You know anything of this?

TWO It's a hard life. I don't expect you to understand.

EX1 Wince
ONE I see.

EX1 Neutral
ONE ...
ONE Your name... Your brother told me it was... Lon'qu.
ONE Are you from Tolmec?

EX2 Neutral
TWO No, I was born here, in the fields of Imrryr.

ONE I see.

TWO ...Why?

ONE It's just that there's a Tolmechian legend of a hero named Lon'qu.

EX1 Happy
ONE My father told me of it once. It was a famous myth of that land.

TWO ...I've never heard it.

ONE A pity. You remind me of him.

TWO ...

ONE Are you coming with us to the village?

TWO I go where Donnel goes.

ONE Good.
