EVE TWO Enters
TWO 'sup?

EX1 Wince
ONE You realize how far we are from home?

EX2 Happy
TWO Of course I do. It's an adventure.
TWO Nothing out here is like it was back in the pasture.
TWO The people are harder, the water tastes sweeter...

EX1 Neutral
ONE You really like it out here?
ONE I mean, it's alright, I guess.
ONE It's just... I kinda miss mom, and the way the sun goes down 
ONE over the mountains.

EX2 Neutral
TWO Yeah, that's pretty special too. But out here... It's just different.
TWO It's like a place where I belong.

EX1 Happy
ONE I'm glad you're happy, Lonnie. I want to see as much of the world as I can!
ONE I mean, this is only our first stop, who knows where we'll end up?

EX2 Happy
TWO Who knows indeed.
