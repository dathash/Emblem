SP2 Lon'qu

ONE -Huff- -Huff-

EX1 Happy
ONE Lonnie, holy cow! I ain't seen you strike a bull that way before!
ONE Where were you keeping that dagger?

EX2 Happy
TWO Early mornings, Donnel. I've been training for a while.

ONE Should'a known. No one's got as much discipline as my brother.

TWO You were pretty sharp yourself, though we ought to find you a proper weapon.

ONE Pitchfork's good enough for the crop, I say it's good enough for these scumbags!

EX2 Neutral
TWO Whatever your feelings, you've got no chance against armored foes.

EX1 Wince
ONE You might be right... I don't suppose that's my strong suit in the long run.

EX2 Happy
TWO Indeed. You seem to do better as a target than as an attacker.
TWO You take punishment like nobody's business.

EX1 Happy
ONE Hell, I always been that way. you 'member that from our bar brawlin' days.

TWO It's one thing to take a bottle, another to take a blade.

EX2 Neutral
TWO I'll keep you in front of me, but be careful, Don. Don't want to make mom worry.

EX1 Neutral
ONE 'course.

ONE Say, what do you think of that one?

TWO Lucina?

EX1 Wince
ONE Yeah, I can't place her accent.

TWO Gaul.

EX1 Neutral
ONE Where?

TWO The Mountains. To the south.

EX1 Neutral
ONE Oh... I didn't know anyone lived up there.

EX2 Happy
TWO Me neither. The world is wide.
TWO It's just a hunch from how she acts. She's like a hero.

EX1 Happy
ONE I have a feeling it's far wider than we could ever imagine.
