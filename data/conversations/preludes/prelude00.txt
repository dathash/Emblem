SP2 Lucina

EVE ONE Enters
ONE Lucina, your training has come a long way, but you still can't match me.
ONE Do not falter now, after all this time.

EVE TWO Enters
EX2 Wince
TWO -huff- -huff-
TWO You're right, it's pitiful.

ONE Not pitiful. All beings begin this life in the same way.
ONE It is only through the innumerable days that strength is gained.

EX2 Neutral
ONE Lucina, your days are just beginning.
ONE Be calm in this knowledge.

EX2 Happy
TWO Thanks, dad. So what next?

EX1 Happy
ONE Today we put your training to the test.

EX2 Neutral
TWO Huh?

EX1 Neutral
ONE There's a group of thieves on the mountain. Sparrow has been tracking them.
ONE We must defend our home.

EX2 Neutral
TWO Fight them? How many? How armed?

EX2 Wince
TWO ... Am I ready?

ONE Of course you are. I have taught you everything...

EX1 Neutral
ONE ... I see. You mean to ask if you are ready to kill a man?

EX2 Neutral
TWO Yes.

EX1 Neutral
ONE Only you may decide.
ONE Remember that all men are sovereign, masters of their own wills.
ONE Some are free. We must respect our adversaries.
ONE But peace can only be upheld through strength.
ONE I would kill before I would let these lands be razed.

TWO ...

ONE One day, you will understand. Come, the outsiders approach.

EVE ONE Exits

TWO I wish you were wrong, father.
TWO Perhaps somewhere, there is a place where strength is outmatched by love.

EVE ONE Enters
ONE Here they are. Our objective is to cut through to their leader.

EX2 Happy
TWO "Cut off the head of the dragon, and the body loses purpose?"

EX1 Happy
ONE Precisely.
