EVE ONE Enters
EX1 Wince
ONE So many of them... I killed so many...

EVE TWO Enters
EX2 Happy
TWO Well done, my daughter!
TWO The blood runs through you, as well.
TWO Come, we will celebrate our victory with the village.

EX1 Angry
ONE They were hardly an organized force... Did we have to kill them all?

EX1 Wince

EX2 Neutral
TWO Lucina, it is better to kill a dying boar than to sustain it through suffering.
TWO We have done what we must. Come, think not of this.

EVE TWO Exits

ONE So I have slaughtered my first man.
ONE My life is consigned to violence.
ONE What other cruel crimes lie ahead?
