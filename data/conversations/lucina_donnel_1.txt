SP1 Lucina
SP2 Donnel

ONE I suppose I should ask their names...
TWO Phew, that fight was a doozy!
ONE My name is Lucina. I'm grateful for your help. What are your names?
TWO I'm Donnel, that's my brother Lon'qu.
TWO We're just a couple of folk passing through. Thought we'd check out the ruckus.
TWO Turned into a brawl real quick, now didn't it?
ONE Indeed. Why did you help me?
TWO Well, no one likes a one-sided fight, you know. Just thought we'd even the odds up a bit.
ONE You don't look like a fighter...
TWO Well, I ain't fight much, but momma didn't raise no fool.
ONE Guess looks can be deceiving.
TWO Where are you headed after this? Looks like you're set up for a long journey.
ONE I... there's someone that I have to find...
TWO Well golly, I know every damned face in town, My brother'n I can show you around!
TWO We can even have a cooked meal, you know, with the loot we snatched off these bandits.
ONE No, we leave the money on them.
TWO What in the hell? We got 'em, fair and square!
ONE They'll need it, where they're going.
TWO ...
ONE I'll head to the village with you two, but I don't expect you to defend me if we run into trouble.
TWO Alright, hop on the cart, and let's get rolling!
