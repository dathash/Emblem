SP1 Lucina
SP2 Donnel

ONE I suppose I should ask their names...

EX2 Happy
TWO Phew, that fight was a doozy!

ONE My name is Lucina. I'm grateful for your help. What are your names?

TWO I'm Donnel, that's my brother Lon'qu.
TWO We're just a couple of folk passing through. Thought we'd check out the ruckus.
TWO Turned into a brawl real quick, now didn't it?

ONE Indeed. Why did you help me?

TWO Well, no one likes a one-sided fight, you know. Just thought we'd even the odds up a bit.

ONE You don't look like a fighter...

TWO Well, I ain't fight much, but momma didn't raise no fool.

EX1 Happy
ONE Guess looks can be deceiving.

EX2 Neutral
TWO Where are you headed after this? Looks like you're set up for a long journey.

EX1 Wince
ONE I... there's someone that I have to find...

EX2 Happy
TWO Well golly, I know every damned face in town, My brother'n I can show you around!
TWO We can even have a cooked meal, you know, with the loot we snatched off these bandits.

EX1 Angry
ONE No, we leave the money on them.

EX2 Wince
TWO What in the hell? We got 'em, fair and square!

EX1 Neutral
ONE They'll need it, where they're going.

EX2 Neutral
TWO ...

EX1 Neutral
ONE I'll head to the village with you two, but I don't expect you to defend me if we run into trouble.

EX2 Happy
TWO Alright, hop on the cart, and let's get rolling!
