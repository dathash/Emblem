EX1 Happy
ONE -phew- Glad that's over!

EVE TWO Enters
ONE So who are you?

EX2 Neutral
TWO Name's Flavia. I'm from Tolmec City. I'm a sellsword.

EX1 Neutral
ONE Sell... sword?

EX2 Happy
TWO I fight for coin. Highest bidder.

ONE Voluntarily?

TWO Everyone's gotta eat, kid. You'll learn when you're older.

EX1 Wince
ONE Reminds me of someone I knew...

EX2 Neutral
TWO Hey kid, you guys still want to see the soothsayer?

EX1 Happy
ONE Of course! If you're still willing to show us the way!

TWO Why?

EX1 Neutral
ONE We each have our reasons.

TWO Personal?

ONE Somewhat. If you must know, I would tell, though it is against my instincts.

EX2 Happy
TWO Don't. Let's get a move on, you don't want to be outdoors when that sun goes down.

EVE TWO Exits
ONE I like her. A good ally.
ONE But to fight for something as useless as money... I don't understand this world.
