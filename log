# Design
What is appealing to me about tactics games?
    Individual Characters
        Strong Characterization
        Developing Relationships
    Permadeath sacrifices
    Gaining new team members
    The beginning of Fire Emblem games are always the best.
    Middle of a level is best.
        Beginning: Setting up, being overly cautious. Not good.
        End: Ganging up on a boss. Pretty much a waste of time.
 
Ideas
* Social Psychology game
    Characterization is deeply ingrained into combat.
        Characters bark, speak their minds.
            Cowardly character doesn't like getting sent to the front lines.
                Performs worse.
                Over time becomes more comfortable, confident.
            Confident character tends to overextend.
                Enemies hit them more often.
        Conversations mid-battle.

* Deep exploration of mechanics
    Fire Emblem reaches a point where it's all sort of the same.
    What if we dug in to this?
        Made mechanics that lended themselves towards extremely specific playstyles?
        Made objectives that required modes of thinking?
        Dropped RPG elements to make way for the new puzzle-style mechanic?

* Shapes game

* Turn Timer game

* Rogue-like combinatoric explosion game

Why are we fighting?
Fire Emblem maps are almost always about killing all the enemies
What about other objectives?
What about Save all the Innocents?
What about Collect all the Items?
What about Escape?
What about anything else?

What do RPG Mechanics really achieve?
* Feeling of commitment to the game.
* Numbers go up hehe
* The strategic decision of nurturing a weak unit until they grow.

Group mechanics (Units nearby eachother get bonuses)
Leader mechanics (Genealogy stars)
Fort with attack bonus instead of defense
Knight Moves?
Jumping tiles in general?
Boost teammate units over stuff?
Misty Step
Area of Effect
Grapple Mechanic, to hold units back so that Zarathustra can charge to the end.

# Story
The story of the game is delivered through the characters.

# TODO
    Conversations
    * Unit Death Screens
    * Cutscenes anytime, not just on end of player turn.

    BUG | Single frame visual glitch before level starts out of a prelude.

    Polished Product! (For Joom Bog)
    * 5 Levels
    * 30 Conversations

    Enemies pursue and destroy villages and chests.

# Later
    10 levels

    AI doesn't wait on every unit that won't act.
    * Run a first pass that just gathers the units that will act, then run with
      those.
    * This will be faster anyways.

    Smooth reinforcements

    More complex conversations
    * Multiple preludes in a row.
    * Animated stuff inbetween.
    * Image backgrounds

POLISH
    Shrink Tilesets to absolute necessity, also enforce consistency across them.
    Smooth Screen Scroll (Render tiles one tile off of the screen.)

QA
    BUG | Enemies that can actually reach you don't believe that they can due to
    the difference in pathfinding/flood filling. We NEED To get a more unified
    solution working.
    BUG | Paths are drawn without regard for walkable squares. EX: When choosing
    a square to place a unit, its path is drawn through an enemy.
