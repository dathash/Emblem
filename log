Plan
> Build a fun little game!

# Design
What is appealing to me about tactics games?
    Individual Characters
        Strong Characterization
        Developing Relationships
    Permadeath sacrifices
    Gaining new team members
    The beginning of Fire Emblem games are always the best.
    Middle of a level is best.
        Beginning: Setting up, being overly cautious. Not good.
        End: Ganging up on a boss. Pretty much a waste of time.
 
Ideas
* Social Psychology game
    Characterization is deeply ingrained into combat.
        Characters bark, speak their minds.
            Cowardly character doesn't like getting sent to the front lines.
                Performs worse.
                Over time becomes more comfortable, confident.
            Confident character tends to overextend.
                Enemies hit them more often.
        Conversations mid-battle.

* Deep exploration of mechanics
    Fire Emblem reaches a point where it's all sort of the same.
    What if we dug in to this?
        Made mechanics that lended themselves towards extremely specific playstyles?
        Made objectives that required modes of thinking?
        Dropped RPG elements to make way for the new puzzle-style mechanic?

* Shapes game

* Turn Timer game

* Rogue-like combinatoric explosion game

Why are we fighting?
Fire Emblem maps are almost always about killing all the enemies
What about other objectives?
What about Save all the Innocents?
What about Collect all the Items?
What about Escape?
What about anything else?

What do RPG Mechanics really achieve?
* Feeling of commitment to the game.
* Numbers go up hehe
* The strategic decision of nurturing a weak unit until they grow.

Group mechanics (Units nearby eachother get bonuses)
Leader mechanics (Genealogy stars)
Fort with attack bonus instead of defense
Knight Moves?
Jumping tiles in general?
Boost teammate units over stuff?
Misty Step
Area of Effect
Grapple Mechanic, to hold units back so that Zarathustra can charge to the end.

# TODO
PROTOTYPE ///////////////////////////////////////////////////
    5 levels

    Do some real design thinking.

    Other Primary Objectives
    * Defeat Boss
    * Rout

    Secondary Objectives
    * Green Units
    * Recruit allies
    * Recruit enemies
    * Chests
      * Items
        * Inventory
        * Using Items
        * Equipping Items
        * Trading Items
        * General Manipulation

    RPG Mechanics
    * Levels
      * Display
        * Level
        * Exp Gain
      * Permanence
        * Save/Load files
      * Variable based on unit level and enemy level.

    Better AI
    * Attack in 2
    * Pursue after X turns
    * Accuracy, health after combat, etc.
    * Bolsters until attacked, then changes to Pursue.

    Slick Turn transitions
    Optional Conversation backgrounds
    BUG | Can Buff when there are no targets?

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

0.1 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    10 levels

    Inbetween Levels | Metagame
    * Recruit new units?
    * Allocate stats?

    More complex conversations
    * Unit Death Screens
    * Up to four conversationists
    * Solo Conversations
    * Multiple preludes in a row.
    * Animated stuff inbetween.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

0.2 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    15 levels

    Cutscenes

    Fire Tile?
    Heal Tile?

    Healing Animation

    Real-time color editing in the editor

    "Guard" action
    Canto? Mounted?

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

POLISH
    Switch Options menu to internal system.
    * Music Volume
    * Resolution?
      * This would require constructing some kind of anchor system, which would
        be an enormous amount of work. If we want to allow for variable
        resolutions, we will need to probably use Qt or something similar.
    * Quit

    Shrink Tilesets to absolute necessity, also enforce consistency across them.
    Create polished tilemaps with Tiled and overlay them onto the in-game maps.
    Smooth Screen Scroll (Render tiles one tile off of the screen.)
    Huge visual flourishes (start of the level causes the tiles to flash in
                            waves, etc.)

QA
    BUG | Controller added mid-game doesn't register joystick, only buttons.
    BUG | Enemy attacks on targets outside the viewport don't get the target
    in view.
    BUG | Enemies that can actually reach you don't believe that they can due to
    the difference in pathfinding/flood filling. We NEED To get a more unified
    solution working.
    BUG | Paths are drawn without regard for walkable squares. EX: When choosing
    a square to place a unit, its path is drawn through an enemy.
