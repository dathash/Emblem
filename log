Plan
> Build a fun little game!

# Notes
July 15
* I'm finding that there are many easy tasks, which are not essential, which I
    love to do, and few very difficult tasks, which are essential, which I do
    not want to do. It is as though the force of gravity pulls me down, away
    from the work that truly needs doing.
* Also of note is that refactoring is pretty enjoyable, especially when I
    write decent code. Maybe it falls into that category of easy tasks above,
    but it feels beneficial in some way.	
* Testing, however, seems to have very little import. I will try some more,
    but it has some crucial flaws.  To test the important parts of the system is
    difficult, and to test the trivial parts of the system is easy.  Must
    reconcile these differences.

November 4
* Returned to the game after a long time away.
    It's actually pretty well put together, and I didn't have a hard time
    reading the code or adding something new.
* I'm still a little intimidated by adding big features, which is next.

# TODO
MVP
    8 levels

    Win and Lose Screens
    Level Transitions

    More sprites
        Priam
        Lon'qu
        Olivia

    Abilities
    * Create a system where a unit possesses one of the following.
        (x) Heal
        ( ) Warp
        ( ) Swap
        ( ) Explode
        ( ) Boost
        ( ) Buff
        ( ) Shield

    BUG | Enemies in the top of the screen with no route to your units seg fault.
    Make level editing easy by starting the game with a level select screen.

    Make just Zarathustra finish levels

NICE
    Battle Animations
    Conversations
    Audio
        Sound Effects
        Drum-n-bass Audio
            Trance-like state of playing
    Shrink Tilesets to absolute necessity, also enforce consistency across them
    for ease of plug-n-play.
    Enemy Units have more complex decision-making process.
    Better enemy AI
        Pursuing Enemies only come for you when you get near.
        * Bresenham's line plus a certain distance (maybe 7 tiles?)

POLISH
    Placing Unit moves them smoothly to that square (A-star)
    Attack and Move / Heal and Move
    Unit damage and healing ranges are displayed.
    BUG | Paths are drawn without regard for walkable squares. EX: When choosing
    a square to place a unit, its path is drawn through an enemy.
    Cycle units with L trigger.
    * Should be able to do this in the same way we cycle units when selecting a
      victim for an attack in command.h
    End turn quickly somehow when you're just moving Zarathustra to the goal?
    Startup Screen

QA
    Controller added mid-game doesn't register joystick, only buttons.
    When the player's turn start, something flashes on the screen.
    * I'm pretty sure I caused this when I went on my big refactor. Check it out
      at your leisure.
    Sometimes enemies end up moving to 0, 0 instead of their intended
    destination, even when the tile is a wall.

REFACTOR
    Change points to its own class with col and row semantics
    * Switch everything over to this.
    remove selectedCol from cursor (DRY)
    Take junk out of main
    Rip out the viewport code (for now). It needs some serious reconsideration.


# Ideas
## Brainstorm
What is appealing to me about tactics games?
    Being in Command
    Individual Characters
        Strong Characterization
        Developing Relationships
    Permadeath sacrifices
    Gaining new team members
    RPG Elements
        Nurturing weak units until they're strong.
        That's it. I pretty much think all other uses of RPG mechanics in these
        games are a waste of time.
        Strategy is good. Just the incessant "Level Up!" portion of Fire Emblem
        makes me sick.
            Big numbers != fun game.
    The beginning of Fire Emblem games are always the best.
    Middle of a level is best.
        Beginning: Setting up, being overly cautious. Not good.
        End: Ganging up on a boss. Pretty much a waste of time.

    
Ideas
* Social Psychology game
    Characterization is deeply ingrained into combat.
        Characters bark, speak their minds.
            Cowardly character doesn't like getting sent to the front lines.
                Performs worse.
                Over time becomes more comfortable, confident.
            Confident character tends to overextend.
                Enemies hit them more often.
        Conversations mid-battle.

* Text-only tactics game?
    In D&D, the grid distracts from the moment-to-moment decisions. It makes
    the game less exciting, not more.
    Perhaps we could imbue a computer game with this sort of think-on-your-feet
    decision-making.
    Would be a lot of work to make the computer be able to communicate your
    situation well enough. This is one area where I have 'em beat.

* Deep exploration of mechanics
    Fire Emblem reaches a point where it's all sort of the same.
    What if we dug in to this?
        Made mechanics that lended themselves towards extremely specific playstyles?
        Made objectives that required modes of thinking?
        Dropped RPG elements to make way for the new puzzle-style mechanic?

* Randomized recruits inbetween levels.
  * Like Auto-chess
