# Brainstorm
What is appealing to me about tactics games?
    Being in Command
    Individual Characters
        Strong Characterization
        Developing Relationships
    Permadeath sacrifices
    Gaining new team members
    RPG Elements
        Nurturing weak units until they're strong.
        That's it. I pretty much think all other uses of RPG mechanics in these
        games are a waste of time.
        Strategy is good. Just the incessant "Level Up!" portion of Fire Emblem
        makes me sick.
            Big numbers != fun game.
    The beginning of Fire Emblem games are always the best.
    Middle of a level is best.
        Beginning: Setting up, being overly cautious. Not good.
        End: Ganging up on a boss. Pretty much a waste of time.

    
Ideas
* Social Psychology game
    Characterization is deeply ingrained into combat.
        Characters bark, speak their minds.
            Cowardly character doesn't like getting sent to the front lines.
                Performs worse.
                Over time becomes more comfortable, confident.
            Confident character tends to overextend.
                Enemies hit them more often.
        Conversations mid-battle.

* Text-only tactics game?
    In D&D, the grid distracts from the moment-to-moment decisions. It makes
    the game less exciting, not more.
    Perhaps we could imbue a computer game with this sort of think-on-your-feet
    decision-making.
    Would be a lot of work to make the computer be able to communicate your
    situation well enough. This is one area where I have 'em beat.

* Deep exploration of mechanics
    Fire Emblem reaches a point where it's all sort of the same.
    What if we dug in to this?
        Made mechanics that lended themselves towards extremely specific playstyles?
        Made objectives that required modes of thinking?
        Dropped RPG elements to make way for the new puzzle-style mechanic?
